This is a test document with some spelling errors.

The word "recieve" appears multiple times in this document.
I want to recieve feedback on this text.
Please recieve my apologies for the errors.

The word "definately" also appears multiple times.
I definately need to check this.
This is definately important.

Some other errors:
- teh quick brown fox
- wierd behavior
- alot of problems
- seperate issues

Let's see if the same error appears multiple times:
- recieve (should only be flagged once per line)
- definately (should only be flagged once per line)
- teh same error teh again (should flag both instances in same line)
